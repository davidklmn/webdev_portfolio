# webdev_portfolio
Portfolio project for the webdev bootcamp.

## Description

I created this site for collecting all of my module challanges throughout the bootcamp. Tried to push myself and create something different than the mockup. For this I was greatly influenced by Seb Kay's portfolio site.  (I tried to figure out some of his code as well and implement into mine. Thanks Seb!)
I am planning to implement new functionality to the page as soon as I learn something new. In this way I can keep myself fully engaged, all the time.

Some part of the CSS coding was challanging but very fun.
